# Supply Chain Analytics: Inventory Optimization and Demand Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on solving real-world supply chain challenges for a retail store selling electronics. The store faces issues with **overstocking** (high storage costs) and **stockouts** (lost sales) due to inefficient inventory management. By analyzing historical sales and inventory data, this project aims to optimize inventory levels and predict future demand to improve operational efficiency.

## Problem Description
The retail store sells a variety of electronics products and struggles with:
1. **Overstocking:** Excess inventory of products like chargers and earphones leads to high storage costs.
2. **Stockouts:** Frequent stockouts of high-demand products like power banks and smartwatches result in lost sales.
3. **Seasonal Demand:** Certain products, such as desk fans, experience significant demand spikes during specific seasons (e.g., summer).

The goal is to use data-driven insights to address these challenges and improve inventory management.

## Goals
1. **Analyze Historical Data:** Understand sales trends, inventory turnover, and product performance.
2. **Predict Demand:** Forecast product demand for the next 6 months using time series analysis.
3. **Optimize Inventory:** Calculate the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) for each product to minimize costs and prevent stockouts.
4. **Provide Recommendations:** Offer actionable insights to improve inventory management and reduce operational costs.
