# Coffee Sales Analysis from Vending Machine

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze coffee sales data from a vending machine using SQL and Power BI. The dataset includes transaction details such as date, time, payment method, amount, and coffee type purchased. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and Power BI for visualization, we can gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and payment preferences.

## Objectives
### Power BI Visualizations
1. **Sales Overview Dashboard**
